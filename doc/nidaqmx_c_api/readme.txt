The files in this ZIP archive are identical to the files installed with NI-DAQmx in the NI-DAQ\docs directory. To access this information from the Windows Start menu, select Start»All Programs»NI-DAQ»Text-Based Code Support»NI-DAQmx C Reference Help.  

To access this information on a computer without NI-DAQmx installed, extract all the files in this ZIP archive and double-click cdaqmx.chm to open it. Note that the NI-DAQmx C Reference Help contains links to other NI-DAQmx Help files that will not be on your computer if you don't have NI-DAQmx installed. The best way to make sure you have all the available NI-DAQmx help is to install NI-DAQmx. 

You cannot view the information in this help file if you launch the cdaqmx.chm directly from the zip file or across a networked drive.
